# Machine Learning Engineer Test: Computer Vision and Object Detection

## Objective
This test aims to assess your skills in computer vision and object detection, with a specific focus on detecting room walls and identifying rooms in architectural blueprints or pre-construction plans.

This test evaluates your practical skills in applying advanced computer vision techniques to a specialized domain and your ability to integrate machine learning models into a simple API server for real-world applications.

Choose one of the visual tasks, one of the text extraction tasks, and the API Server task. We encourage you to submit your tests even if you canâ€™t complete all tasks.

Good luck!
